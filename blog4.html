  <h3>
    CSS Animations
  </h3>
  <p>
    CSS allows animation of HTML elements without using JavaScript or Flash! Animations allows an element to change from
    one style to another.
    The CSS properties as many times as you want. To do CSS animation, there must be some keyframes for the animation.
    Keyframes control what styles that the element will have and at what point during the animation.
  </p>
  <p>
    A basic example would be:
  </p>
  <div id="basic"></div>
  <p>
    The code for this animation:

    <pre>
      <code>
      #basic {
        width: 100px;
        height: 100px;
        background-color: blue;
        animation-name: example;
        animation-duration: 4s;
      }

      @keyframes example {
        from {background-color: blue;}
        to {background-color: purple;}
      }
      </code>
  </pre>
    It changes the background color from blue to purple in 4 seconds. Once the animation is done, it changes back to the
    original color.
    More colors can be used if percentages were used in the keyframes instead of using from and to. More than one aspect
    can be changed at each stage. An example with this would be:
  </p>
  <div id="outer">
    <div id="per"></div>
  </div>
  <p>
    The code for this animation:
    <pre>
      <code>
        #per {
          width: 100px;
          height: 100px;
          animation-name: sample;
          animation-duration: 4s;
          background-color: pink;
          position: relative;
        }     

        @keyframes sample {
          0% {background-color: pink; left:0px; top:0px;}
          25% {background-color: green; left: 0px; top:100px;}
          50% {background-color: blue; left: 100px; top: 100px;}
          75% {background-color: purple; left: 100px; top: 0px;}
          100% {background-color: pink; left: 0px; top: 0px;}
        }
      </code>
    </pre>
    There are many other attributes that can be used with animations, like delaying the animation, setting how many times the animation
    should run. The animation could run in reverse or alternate forward and backwards. The timing could change to have slower and faster parts.
    By default, the animation will only impact the element during the keyframes, bu that can be overridden with fill-mode. There is shorthand
    for animaiton with the format of name, duration, timeing-function, delay, iteration count, then direction.
    An example with many of these properties is:
  </p>
  <div id="first"></div>
  <p>
    The code used for this is:
    <pre>
      <code>
        #first {
          width: 100px;
          height: 100px;
          background-color: blue;
          animation: example 4s ease 2s infinite alternate;
        }

        @keyframes example {
          from {background-color: blue;}
          to {background-color: purple;}
        }
      </code>
    </pre>
    It switches different background colors on a loop.
  </p>
  <h3>CSS Transitions</h3>
  <p>
    CSS transitions allow changes to the property values over a given duration. To use transitions, the CSS property and the duration must be specified.
    An example that changes the width when hovered is:
  </p>
  <div id="tran"></div>
  <p>
    The code for this is:
    <pre>
      <code>
        #tran {
          width: 100px;
          height: 100px;
          background: red;
          transition: width 2s;
        }
        
        #tran:hover {
          width: 300px;
        }
      </code>
    </pre>
    When the curser isn't hovering over it, it resumes its original shape. The transitions do not have to be the same duration.
  </p>
  <div>
    <div id="dif"></div>
  </div>
  <p>
    Notice how it takes longer for the width to change than the height. This is done with the code:
    <pre>
      <code>
        #dif {
          width: 100px;
          height: 100px;
          background: green;
          transition: width 2s, height 4s;
        }
        
        #dif:hover {
          width: 200px;
          height: 50px;
        }
      </code>
    </pre>
    Other things that can be with transition is timing and delay, the same as animation. Animations and transitions are similar, but 
    transitions are usually based on an action, like hover or click, where animations have more control over when they are animating.
