  <h3>Which is better, Flexbox or CSS Grid?</h3>
  <p>
    For starters, Flexbox is flat, while Grid is made for two dimensions. Flexbox is based in the content and Grid
    focuses on the layout. Grid has predefined grid places for each item to go into, while Flexbox is much more, well,
    flexible. Although each can be used to do what the other does, flexbox can create two-dimensional layouts with
    wrapping and Grid can make one-dimensional layouts. Since grid is better for precisiously placing objects with
    properites like
    grid-template rows and grid-template columns, it is better for creating unusal layouts, such as broken,
    asymmetrical, and overlapping layouts.
    CSS Grid is currently supported by 93.88% of browsers and Flexbox is supported on 97.33% of all browsers.
    They are both supported most everywhere at this point.
  </p>
  <p>
    A major difference is that grid has a gap property to create space between the grid items. In flexbox, there is no
    easy way
    to do that, but a few roundabout ways. While grid and flexbox can both be used for most tasks, there is usally one
    that should
    be used over the other. Flexbox uses flex-grow and flex-shrink to stretch and squeeze into the available space,
    while grid
    uses a combination of minmax and auto-fill functions inside the grid-template-columns property. They are each
    designed to solve
    their own problems.

    I will make the same navigation bar using both types to see the differences between them.

  <h4>Flexbox</h4>
  <div class="flex-root">
    <div class="flex">Home</div>
    <div class="flex">Search</div>
    <div class="flex" id="flex-end">Logout</div>
  </div>
  <p>
    The code for Flexbox is :<br>
    .flex-root {<br>
    display: flex;<br>
    background-color: mistyrose;<br>
    justify-content: space-between;<br>
    }<br>

    .flex {<br>
    padding-right: 7%;<br>
    }<br>

    #flex-end {<br>
    margin-left: auto;<br>
    }<br>
  </p>
  <h4>Grid</h4>
  <div class="grid-root">
    <div>Home</div>
    <div>Search</div>
    <div id="grid-end">Logout</div>
  </div>
  <p>
    The code for Flexbox is :<br>
    .grid-root {<br>
    background-color: mistyrose;<br>
    display: grid;<br>
    grid-template-columns: repeat(10, 1fr);<br>
    }<br>

    #grid-end {<br>
    grid-column: 10;<br>
    }
