                <p>
                        There are more mobile devices than people in the world! This means that it is important for your website to work on 
                        mobile devices. A mobile-friendy website is a site that is optimized for users on mobile devices. Today's websites are
                        moving to a scaling format where they can quickly adjust to the device's specifications. Google is now using a Mobile-First
                        indexing, so the content, links, speed, and user experience on mobile sites will be important for search engine visibility.
                        This makes sense because more searches happen on mobile devices than on desktops in today's world.

                        Having media queries is a popular way for a tailored style sheet based on the specifications of the device and 
                        displays according to the settings in the CSS that correspond to that size. For example, @media screen and (min-width: 1024px) would 
                        be the setting for desktops. The difficult thing is to ensure that the system is properly configured for all device, not
                        just what is popular and that the list stays up to date with current releases.

                        There are frameworks like Bootstrap that is designed to automatically scale your web page to any device. Responsive themes
                        make it easier to have a good display, instead of a basic design on the mobile site, though mobile users prefer simple site
                        designs than anything overly designed. The users want the information easy and fast. Another easy step is to use more universal
                        software to ensure that it is compatabile with more systems than something specialized. For example, mobile devices typically 
                        do not support Flash, so if the website relies on Flash, it will not work on any mobile device.

                        The most obvious way is not to hardcode any sizes of objects and do them as percentages instead of pixels. It ensures 
                        a consistent layout on different devices. If a width is 200 pixels, it will take up a drastically different portion of the 
                        screen if it is on a mobile devices instead of a desktop. Shrinking an image for a mobile page will help the page load faster
                        and helps the page look nicer in the smaller format. Keep in mind that desktops are a horizontal screen, while mobile devices
                        are typically more vertical. Remember direction and how people will view the content.
