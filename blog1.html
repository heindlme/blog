                <h2>Accessibility</h2>
                <p>The web must be designed to work for all people. The UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities states that access to information and communication technologies is a basic human right, so developers and organizations need to allow all aspects of the web to be accessible. Accessibility supports social inclusion. An example of web accessibility is having alternative text for images, &lt;img alt="description"&gt;. All functionality must be available to be used from a keyboard, in case a mouse is not available. There must also be transcipts for audio, like an alt tag for an image. If there is no description for an image(like visual decoration), there should be an empty alt tag. Otherwise, a screenreader would read out the URL.</p>
                <p>A way to increase acessibility is to have good semantics in the code, like to help with screenreaders and can skip to different sections of the page with the headings. There also needs to be a sufficient color contrast between text and background. <span class="contrast">This is bad contrast!</span> <span class="bright">Others do not like bright colors!</span> Another thing is to watch out for moving, flashing, or blinking content, which includes carousels, ads, and videos. Make sure that no content flashes more than 3 times a second and the user can control or stop any moving, blinking, or scrolling information. A tip is to use clear language that is not overly confusing and avoid characters that are not read clearly from a screenreader. Don't use dashes and expand abbreviations.</p>
